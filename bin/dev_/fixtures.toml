# Fixtures - initial data set up automatically on dev environment startup
#
# Applied automatically by: ./bin/dev
# Run manually with: ./bin/dev fixtures
#
# Fixtures are applied in order. Each fixture type:
#   bucket  - Create a bucket
#   file    - Upload a file to a bucket
#   dir     - Create a directory in a bucket
#   share   - Share a bucket with a peer (role: owner/mirror)
#   publish - Publish a bucket (grant decryption to mirrors)
#   mv      - Move/rename a file or directory

This is a test bucket for demonstrating jax-bucket features.

- `/hello.txt` - A simple greeting

## Sharing
This bucket is shared with:
- `app` node as **owner** (can read/write)
- `gw` node as **mirror** (can sync, decrypt after publish)
