## Overview

JaxBucket is a local-first, encrypted storage system built on [Iroh](https://iroh.computer/). It provides content-addressed, encrypted file storage with automatic peer-to-peer synchronization between authorized devices.

## Features

- 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption**: All files encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD
- 🌐 **P2P Sync**: Automatic synchronization via Iroh's networking stack
- 📦 **Content-Addressed**: Files and directories stored as immutable, hash-linked DAGs
- 🔑 **Cryptographic Key Sharing**: ECDH + AES Key Wrap for secure multi-device access
- 🌳 **Merkle DAG Structure**: Efficient verification and deduplication
- 🎯 **Local-First**: Works offline, syncs when connected
- 📌 **Selective Pinning**: Control which content to keep locally
- 🌍 **DHT Discovery**: Find peers via distributed hash table

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install JaxBucket
cargo install jax-bucket

# Initialize configuration
jax init

# Start the service
jax service

# Open web UI at http://localhost:8080
```

For detailed installation instructions and requirements, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
